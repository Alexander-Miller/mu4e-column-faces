* Mu4e Column faces

This package provides a minor mode that allows using individual faces for the columns in mu4e's email overview.

** Example

/Before:/
[[file:img/before.png]]

/After:/
[[file:img/after.png]]

/Before:/
[[file:img/before-light.png]]

/After:/
[[file:img/after-light.png]]

** Installation

mu4e-column-faces is available on Melpa. Download it with the package manager of your choice and then simply enable
~mu4e-column-faces-mode~ after mu4e was loaded:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package mu4e-column-faces
    :after mu4e
    :config (mu4e-column-faces-mode))
#+END_SRC

or

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'mu4e
    (mu4e-column-faces-mode))
#+END_SRC

** Configuration

The various faces are all named after the headers in ~mu4e-header-info~, e.g. ~mu4e-column-faces-date~. Other than these
faces there is nothing else to configure.

This package does not seem to have an impact on performance. If you want to make sure for your own setup you can set
~mu4e-headers-report-render-time~ to ~t~ and compare the render times with and without ~mu4e-column-faces-mode~.
